Micro-Service Solution for the Travel Agency, this project leverages micro-service architecture.

Key Features:

Micro-Service Architecture: The project embraces a micro-service architecture, breaking down complex functionalities into smaller, independent services.

Spring Boot Applications: I used Spring Boot because it provides a robust framework for building RESTful APIs.

Java for REST API Development: I used Java to develop RESTful APIs, which serve as the communication of the micro-services.

MySQL Database: MySQL database to manage and store data.
